<h3>The steps to alchemy</h3>
<p>Alchemy has three steps comprehension, deconstruction and Reconstruction.

Deconstruction is the use of energy used to mold down the physical structure of the material.
Reconstruction reforms the material into a new object. The molecules most equal to the molecules started with. One should never try humman transmutation the results are devastating.</p>
