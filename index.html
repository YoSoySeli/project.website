<h3>The step to alchemy</h3>
<p>Alchemy has three steps comprehension, deconstruction and Reconstruction.
Comprehension is the act of understanding what the molecular structure is of that object that is desired.
Deconstruction is the use of energy used to mold down the physical structure of the material.
Reconstruction reforms the material into a new object. The molecules most equal to the molecules started with. One should never try humman transmutation the results are devastating.</p>
